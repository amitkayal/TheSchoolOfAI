# TSAI Session 23

Project for The School of AI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Objectives

1. PyTorch 101. Refer to this file: COLAB LINK (Links to an external site.)
2. You need to go through this file, perform tons of experiments and then proceed to answer the questions in Quiz Q3. Please note that you only have 15 minutes to take the quiz, so you won't have time to answer the question by performing the experiments while the quiz is in progress. So work on the Colab file first, understand the code, try and fix bugs, if any, and then proceed to answer the quiz questions. 
3. Once you are done, submit your answers in P2S4 Quiz.
