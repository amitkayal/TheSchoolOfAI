# Objectives

Implement the following:
1. Use dlib Face Detector 
2. Align the face using 5-pt detector and align (take a 5 second video of your face with some translation and rotation (not extreme)
3. Calculate 68-pt landmark on the aligned faces
4. Calculate the optical flow for these 68-pts every frame
5. Stabilize the optical flow using LK method as we discussed. 
6. Create a 5 second video, with three windows:
  * First: Original frame
  * Aligned Frame with unstabilized points
  * Aligned Frame with stabilized points. 
  * If the original video was 400x400 resolution, final video is 1200x400. Final video is 5 seconds and we need to see all 3 videos side by side for comparison. 
7. Upload to youtube, and embed the video in your readme file. 
8. Share the link. 

Note: This is a group of 4 assignment. All 4 CAN share same code and same video or different too.
