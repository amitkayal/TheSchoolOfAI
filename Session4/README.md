# TSAI_Session4

Project 4 for The School of AI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## *Assignment 4:*

### After 4 code iterations achieve:
1. *99.4% accuracy*
2. *Less than 15k Parameters*
3. Have started from a Vanilla network (no BN, DropOut, LR, larger batch size, change in Optimizer, etc)

### Things to keep in mind:
1. Make sure you are tracking your code's performance, and writing down your observations are you achieve better or worse results
2. Your second code can only have max 2 improvements over first one, third can have only max 2 over second and so on.
3. All of your iterations are in different CODE BLOCKS and named properly like First CODE, Second CODE, etc
4. All of your code is very well documented
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Best Validation Accuracy Achieved: 99.42%

### With Following Parameters:
1. Batch Normalisation
2. Dropout = 0.15
3. Optimizer = Adam [Default Learning Rate LR=0.001]
4. Batch Size=32
5. Epoch = 17
6. **Total params**: 14,024, 
7. **Trainable params**: 13,760, **Non-trainable params**: 264
8. Validation loss: 2.33%
